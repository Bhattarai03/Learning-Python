# Arithmetic Operator

a = 7
b = 5
c=a+b
print(c)

# Assignment Operator

a = 9-3  # Assign 9-3 in a
print(a)
b =  9
b += 6   # Increment the value of b by 6 and then assign it to  b
print(b)
c=15
c -= 9   # Decrement in th value of c by   9 and then assign it to c
print(c)

# Comparision Operator

f = 7 != 6
g = 6 == 5
h = 7 >= 6
i = 9 <= 4

print(f)
print (g)
print(h)
print (i)
